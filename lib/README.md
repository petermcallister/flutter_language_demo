# Overview


This app, using Flutter, is a life counter application for the card game "Magic the Gathering." Because there are a lot of different formats for this card game, I choose the most common one -Commander. It can have up to 4 players - each starting with 40 life. It allows the user to click in a text box and edit the life total inside of it. 

The purpose of writing this code is to display my knowledge of Flutter so far. As this is my first time every using FLutter, I had to learn all the different syntax's, how to create a new program in Flutter, and how to run the code. I also have been playing Magic for a while now and I thought this could become a useful tool for when I play in the future.

# Development Environment

I used the following tools in my creation of this app:

1. **Flutter SDK:** An open-source toolkit for building natively compiled applications across different platforms.
2. **Dart Programming Language:** Dart is used for writing the logic of the Flutter application.
3. **Visual Studio Code:** The IDE used to program in dart/ flutter.
4. **Google Chrome:** Used as an emulator for testing and running Flutter applications.
5. **Command-Line Tools:** Used for tasks such as running, building, and managing dependencies in Flutter projects.
6. **Git:** Allows me to share my work with others to see what my code looks like.

The programming language used in the provided code is called Dart. Dart is used for building web, mobile, and desktop applications. In regards to the code itself, standard Flutter libraries are used. Flutter is a UI software development toolkit, and it comes with a set of pre-built widgets that implement the Material Design guidelines. Widgets like text fields, buttons, and containers simplify UI development. The `TextEditingController` class is used to control text fields, enabling developers to initialize and listen for changes in the text field's value.

The code utilizes Flutter's built-in state management system, where the `setState()` method helps manage and update the user interface based on user interactions. This combination of Dart and Flutter provides a straightforward and effective way to create cross-platform applications with a focus on simplicity, performance, and a visually appealing user interface.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add an option to add/ subtract players.
- Add buttons to add/ subtract/ claculate life totals.
- Refine how it looks visually.
